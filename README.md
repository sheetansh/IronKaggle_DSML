# Machine Learning project : You’ll build a regression model to predict house prices based on their characteristics. 

#### Workflow:

1. Load the dataset
2. Explore the data to understand its structure — features, target variable, shape, and data types.
3. Clean the dataset (handle duplicates, missing values, etc.).
4. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
5. Explore correlations between the target and features, and among features. Include your interpretations.
6. Handle categorical variables (encoding).
7. Train baseline models such as Linear Regression and KNN Regressor.
8. Evaluate the models using metrics like R² and MAE.
9. Improve your models:
    - Data side: handle outliers ( when tuning remember to Re-Check Outliers furthest from Data, removing and trying again)
    - multicollinearity
    - feature selection
    - normalization/standardization
    - feature engineering, etc.
    - Model side: try other models (especially ensemble methods) and perform hyperparameter tuning.
10. Compare all models and select the best one.
11. Identify which features most strongly influence house prices(target) based on your best model.
